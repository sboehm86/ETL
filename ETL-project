# Quick Summary

Our ETL project took data from two different countries and compiled it into one
database for ease of access and analysis. The database has viral videos from You-
Tube for the US and France for 2019 and encompasses each videos: likes, dislikes
and views in addition to the metadata for each video. We provided our data as a
CSV in the Mongo DB which allows for rapid sorting and comparison of the two
datasets.
