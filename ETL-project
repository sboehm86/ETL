# Quick Summary

Our ETL project took data from two different countries and compiled it into one
database for ease of access and analysis. The database has viral videos from You-
Tube for the US and France for 2019 and encompasses each videos: likes, dislikes
and views in addition to the metadata for each video. We provided our data as a
CSV in the Mongo DB which allows for rapid sorting and comparison of the two
datasets.

To use the DB:
1. Start MongoDBCompass
2. Log In with your user info
3. Click the plus button on the bottom left
4. Specify both the DB and Collection names; click create
5. Click the import button and navigate to us_fr_database

# Narrative/Motivation

Social media are very important in our society as users spend a lot of time
online. They see social media as an important source of information about
diverse topics. YouTube having an important role in the social media industry,
it is a main virtual crossroad where people can share their view, opinion, life,
etc.

YouTube has became a strong platform to promote products or services of
companies. The popularity of the videos determines their availability to the
audience. For instance, the video with the most views becomes more popular and
becomes mainstream.

After cleaning, organizing, storing data under one dataset, companies could use
the database to perform analysis on what category are more popular than others.
They could also analyze the numbers of views vs. likes/dislikes.

# Data Model

We didnâ€™t need a Data Model because the two data frames were identical before
and after cleaning them.

# Data Sources

This dataset is obtained from Kaggle.com and is a record of trending YouTube
videos for various countries. Data is available for USA, France, Japan among
other regions.
The US region has it csv file and the French region has a xlsx file. Each file
includes various columns like video title, channel name, publish time, tags,
views count, number of likes and dislikes, comment counts, etc.

# Transformation
A clean dataset was created containing data for two regions (US and France) by
converting the xlsx file to csv and then combining both in MongoDBCompass

Steps:
Read each csv files to a pandas data frame
Cleaned the data frames to include only relevant columns that could be useful
for a data analysis.
The data frames for the three regions were then combined into one single data
frame containing 80k+ rows
